# Description of the project 
The aim of this project was to create a simple but powerfull device commonly used in biology laboratories - OD600 meter. Thanks to this, one can measure the optical density of bacteria or yeast culture solution in 600 nm wavelength peak. It is commonly known that even such simple machines are sometimes overpriced and because of that we decided to make functional, on budget samll device to measure it. 
# Science and tech used 
We use the Lambert-Beer law to measure it. Even thought this formula refers specifically to absorption, it is also used in case of dispersal. It measures first the BLANK (usually the growing medium without microrganisms - more on that later) which is the background also refered as I0, and the SAMPLE containing the microrganisms (noted as I). From Lambert-Beer we know that: A=log_10(I0/I), where A is absorption. There's visible, linear corelation between OD600 and the number of microrganisms in the solution in some range (from 0.1 to 1.0 OD).
